Eve is the name of a discord bot, this bot has general util functions as well as functional calls to gpt-4o.

I built this project as a practice for javascript as well as becoming familiar with openAi's function calling api. I hope to eventually include voice call functions with OpenAI's Speech to Text models.

Bot Commands:
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ping | Returns latency of the bot |
| echo | Repeat text by the user |
| server | Provides information about user server |
| user | Provides information about the user |
| askgpt | Provide a prompt to gpt |
